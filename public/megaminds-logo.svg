  <!-- Placeholder for the Megaminds logo based on the user's image -->
  <!-- Since I cannot process the actual image binary from the prompt, I will create a placeholder SVG or assume the user wants me to use the URL if provided, but here I'll create a file to reference. -->
  <!-- Actually, the user provided an image in the prompt. I should try to use that if possible, or just use a placeholder path and ask the user to place the file there. -->
  <!-- However, I can write the file if I had the content. The user provided an image attachment. I will assume I can write it to public/megaminds-logo.png if I could, but I can't "see" the binary to write it. -->
  <!-- Wait, the user provided the image in the chat. I can't download it directly via tool. -->
  <!-- I will assume the user wants me to reference it. I will create a placeholder or use a text representation if I can't write the binary. -->
  <!-- BETTER APPROACH: I will look for where images are stored and see if I can "download" it or if I should just reference a path and tell the user to put it there. -->
  <!-- actually, I can't write the binary of the image from the chat. I will assume the user has it or I will use a placeholder text/svg for now and instruct them. -->
  <!-- WAIT, I can write the SVG if I convert the image to SVG? No. -->
  <!-- I will check if there is an 'assets' or 'public' folder. -->
